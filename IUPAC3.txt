Unsaturated Hydrocarbons

Double bonds in hydrocarbons are indicated by replacing the suffix -ane with -ene.
 If there is more than one double bond, the suffix is expanded to include a prefix that indicates the number of double bonds present (-adiene, -atriene, etc.). 
Triple bonds are named in a similar way using the suffix -yne.
 The position of the multiple bond(s) within the parent chain is(are) indicated by placing the number(s) of the first carbon of the multiple bond(s) directly in front of the base name.

Here is an important list of rules to follow:

The parent chain is numbered so that the multiple bonds have the lowest numbers (double and triple bonds have priority over alkyl and halo substituents).

When both double and triple bonds are present, numbers as low as possible are given to double and triple bonds even though this may at times give "-yne" a lower number than "-ene".
 When there is a choice in numbering, the double bonds are given the lowest numbers.

When both double and triple bonds are present, the -en suffix follows the parent chain directly and the -yne suffix follows the -en suffix (notice that the e is left off, -en instead of -ene). 
The location of the double bond(s) is(are) indicated before the parent name as before, and the location of the triple bond(s) is(are) indicated between the -en and -yne suffixes.

Cyclic Compounds

A cyclic (ring) hydrocarbon is designated by the prefix cyclo- which appears directly in front of the base name.
When substitutions are present on a cyclic compound, the number can start from the carbon where the group is present itself as in cyclic there is no start point or end point.
